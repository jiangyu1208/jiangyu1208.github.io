Hello, thanks for visiting my blog. 

My name is Yu Jiang and I was born and raised in Chongqing, a city famous for tasty foods and attracting night views located in the southwest of China. After finishing my bachelor's degree in coastal engineering from Harbin Engineering University, I have entered Texas A&M University to continue my study as a master student in civil engineering. When studying in TAMU, I was required to take some statistical courses fto fulfill the requirement of degree through which I have gradually developed a strong interest in statistics and become a data lover. 

Later, I have made up my mind to shift my major from engineering to statistics and fortunately, I have been admitted to the master program of statistics at North Carolina State University starting from FALL19, beginning my another journey.

Now, I am preparing for the application of PhD program starting from FALL21 and hope that everything will work out.

### More Information

I enjoy cooking during my spare time and am going to have a cat when I can live a place for a while.
