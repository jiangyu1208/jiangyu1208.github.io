Q1: What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  

I have used SAS and Python besides R. In my views, R is the language closest to the natural language than SAS and Python.
They have some functions in common, for example, ggplot, both in R and Python.


Q2: What functionality do you like about R?  

There are many existing packages in R and we can use them directly by requiring the library.

Q3: What parts do you miss about your other language?  

The running time is faster for Python than R, especially when it comes to loops.


Q4: Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)

R is a pretty user-friendly language designed for statistical learner. When I first learned R, I even do not the usage of x <- c(...) but 
it is very convenient that the help file can help users learn a new package or a function by themselves.
