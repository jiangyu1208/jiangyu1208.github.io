# Outline of Project 1

This project is about analysing NHL data and contains four main parts: Describe JSON Data, Three Packages for Reading JSON Data into R, 
Writing Functions to Contact the NHL records and Data Analysis. 

For the first part, 'Describe JSON Data', I have answered these questions: what is Json? where does it get used and 
why is it a good way to store data? 

For the second part, 'Three Packages for Reading JSON Data into R', I have discussed three popular packages in R for reading JSON data: 
'rjson', 'RJSONIO' and 'jsonlite' and have chosen 'jsonlite' for my project because of its fastest speeds compared with another 
two packages.

# Findings from Project 1

For this project, I focused on the data about wins and losses since many people pay attention to the sports results. I treat two variables
'activeFranchise' and 'gameTypeId' as factors. After analysing data, I have found the number of active and type 2 is much larger than that
of non-active and type 3. Also, the relationships between wins and losses are almost straight line when making a scatter plots.

# Reflection on Project 1

## What would you do differently?

It is important to understand the background of the data deeply so that data analyst can better manipulate the data better and present 
more results. Therefore, I would learn the background of the data more deeper and go deeper into the analyst.

## What was the most difficult part for you?

It is the most difficult to get involve in GitHub and also write a function to query API since it usually takes me several times 
to return the approriate results.

## What are your big take-aways from this project?

I have learned how to connect Rstudio with GitHub and how to produce the website from rmarkdown through GitHub through this project.
