What do you think being a data scientist is about? 

According to the article "Data Scientists Versus Statisticians" mentioned, “A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.” Therefore, I think a data scientist is someone with both staitical knowledge and programming skills, for example, R.

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

The major duty for a data scientist is to address the real-life problems, financial, industries, healthcare, high-tech, to name a few by data analysis with a programming language.

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

Differences: for statisticians, they focus more on the statistical theories and smaller scale methods while for data scientists, they are paying more attention to large scale of data and to the applied statistics.
Similarities: both statisticans and data scientists rely on collected data to address real-life problems

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

As a master student in statistics, it strengths my statistical knowledge with all the courses taken during my study period, contributing more to be a statistican. During my spare time, it improves me programming skills by practice coding within the guidence of statistics, helping me be a data scientist.
