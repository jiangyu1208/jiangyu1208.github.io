# How is the course going so far?  

This is an amazing course and I have learned a great deal from it. I knew something about R and RStudio before this class and learned them 
systematically through ST558. This is a challenging and practical course and almost covers everything about data science.

# What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?

I enjoy the discussion board since I can not only gain the timely help from Dr.Post and TA but also from other helpful remote classmmates. 
The time for every lecture is not rather long so that I can focus on the lecture efficiently and the lecture are taught by cases, giving 
me an idea how to deal with the similar problems in the real life. Also, it covers most of the popular topics, like the decision tree, ML
and regression, etc, which will usually be asked in the interview about data science.

I have two suggestions for this course: the first one is that it can accelerate the lecture about the basic of R, RStudio and some basic syntax, for example,
how to access objects in R since they are easier compared with the contents given later, like improving R program and regressions which deserve
more time; the second one is that the project can be done with a small group like 2 persons so that we can share our ideas and communicate 
more with each other.

# Any other thoughts?  (I just like to hear how everyone is doing and get feedback to incorporate!

The timeline for this course overally is a little tight since there are usually two dues in one week and sometimes there is not enough 
time to digest everything in one module. For the due day, Monday is not so good since sometimes we cannot receive the reply timely on
weekends and is there any possible to change it to Tuesday and Friday instead ?
