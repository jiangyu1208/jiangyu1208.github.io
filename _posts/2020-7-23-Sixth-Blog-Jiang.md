# What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?

From the initial blog, I have mentioned that a data scientist focuses more on programming skills than the statistical knowledge and their major duty is to change the results 
from statisticans into the code using R, Python or other programming but the three projects from the ST558 have changed my views. 

A qualified data scientist is the person with both excellent statistical knowledge and programming skills. To some extent, it is more important to master solid statistical 
knowledge than programming skills since it is almost impossible to code without throughly understanding the statistical theory behind the real-life problems. 

Both the statistical knowledge and the programming skills are prerequisites to be a good data scientist. Also, it is significant to communicate with others who have some 
statistical knowledge or even without knowing statistical theory during the team. 

# What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?

R is an excellent free programming language and RStudio plays a role in sharing people's ideas and showing their analysis in PDF, HTML, Slides, etc. The most wonderful part of it
is that there is the RStudio Community which allows people to post their questions and look for solutions to common questions from RStudio. 

For me, I will continue to use R for my future data analysis and presentation but I will also switch to other language who is faster in looping and machine learning than R.

# What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

I will focus more on the advanced part of R in the future, like shiny part. Before taking the course, I have some basic knowledge of R without considering the advanced part of it.
After taking this course, I have realized that there are more advanced things needed to be learned comparing to simply using R to get the statistical results.
